## Literature for Simplicial Complex Reading

* Estrada, E., & Ross, G. (2017). Centralities in Simplicial Complexes. Application to Protein Interaction networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.03641 - Highly recommended to read as it provides a fantastic introduction to Simplicial Complexes & Centralities.
* Xia, K. and Wei, G. (2014). Persistent homology analysis of protein structure, flexibility, and folding. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering, 30(8), pp.814-844. - Persistent Homology incorporating Simplicial Complexes to derive Molecular Topological Fingerprints (MTFs). These were used for protein identification, classification of proteins and more importantly, understanding the topology-function relationship of these macromolecules.
* Cang, M., Mu, L., Wu, K., Opron, K., Xia, K. and Wei G. (2015) A topological approach for protein classification. arXiv 1510.00953v1 - Uses MTFs in paper above in ML approaches with SVMs to predict protein classification.


## Literature on Centrality Measures
* Hahn, M. and Kern, A. (2004). Comparative Genomics of Centrality and Essentiality in Three Eukaryotic ProteinInteraction Networks. Molecular Biology and Evolution, 22(4), pp.803-806. - Use node-degree centrality to study protein essentiality in yeast, worms, and flies.
* Mahadevan, R. and Palsson, B. (2005). Properties of Metabolic Networks: Structure versus Function. Biophysical Journal, 88(1), pp.L07-L09. - Opposed view as paper above, finding that node-degree centrality does not always correlate to essentiality.
* del Rio, G., Koschützki, D. and Coello, G. (2009). How to identify essential genes from molecular networks?. BMC Systems Biology, 3(1), p.102. - Proposed the revolutionary idea of combining centrality measures for more accurate protein essentiality prediciton.
* Chapter 4 of “Analysis of Biological Networks,“ edited by Bjorn J. Junker and Falk Schreiber, John Wiley & Sons, 2008 - Easy to read and provides good introduction into Centrality Measures in PPI networks.
