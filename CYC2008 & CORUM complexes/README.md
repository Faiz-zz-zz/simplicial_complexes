## CYC 2008 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

CYC2008 provides an up-to-date reference set of yeast protein complexes for both experimental biologists who work on yeast protein complexes and computational biologists who are interested in predicting protein-protein interactions and protein complexes in yeast.


## CORUM (Mammalian species)


The CORUM database provides a resource of manually annotated protein complexes from mammalian organisms. Annotation includes protein complex function, localization, subunit composition, literature references and more. All information is obtained from individual experiments published in scientific articles, data from high-throughput experiments is excluded.


## Potential Candidate Databases for Protein-Protein Interaction Data

* BioGRID – mentioned in the tutor meeting and very popularly used database. Mo already downloaded ALL human interaction and yeast interaction data (RAW) from BioGRID. 
This might not be the specific subset of CYC2008/CORUM list of complexes we were expected to operate with.

* STRING – Another very popular protein interaction network database used by researchers.

* MIPS – “In deriving such networks for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the most widely used ‘gold standard’ dataset has been the manually curated protein complexes catalogued in the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) database.” [2] CYC2008 list of complexes were downloaded from a MIPS database.

* E2D (I believe this is the name) – Large amount of annotated proteins here are from prediction methods so making predictions based on other prediction is not a very wise strategy. Not recommended to use this database.
**_Maybe you meant I2D - She said its the 2nd best to Biogrid but to steer clear of data build from predictions._** 

## Next steps - Collect biological annotations of the proteins from:
* http://www.geneontology.org/
* ncbi

## Downloads (found in folders)
Downloaded the list of all complexes in CYC 2008 (408 heteromeric protein complexes in S. cerevisiae) and CORUM (2837 protein complexes, 64% human).
